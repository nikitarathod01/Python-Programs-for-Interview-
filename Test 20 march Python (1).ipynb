    "   Tuple: Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed.\n",

    "   List: Lists are defined using square brackets [].\n",
    "   Tuple: Tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
    "3. Performance:\n",
    "   List: Lists are slower than tuples due to their mutability.\n",
    "   Tuple: Tuples are faster than lists because of their immutability.\n",
    "4. Usage:\n",
    "   List: Lists are used when the collection of elements needs to be modified or updated.\n",

    "   Tuple: Tuples consume less memory compared to lists because of their fixed nature.\n",
    "6. Methods:\n",

    "   Tuple: Tuples have fewer methods since they are immutable and do not support operations that modify the tuple.\n",

Additionally, Python supports the concept of packages, which are a way of structuring the module namespace using dotted module names to create a hierarchical organization of related modules.

    "In Python, handling exceptions is crucial for managing errors and ensuring the smooth execution of programs. Here is an overview of how exceptions are handled in Python:\n",
    "1. Try-Except Block:\n",
    "The try block is used to test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "The except block is used to handle the error that occurs in the try block.\n",
    "If an exception occurs in the try block, the program jumps to the except block to handle the error.\n",
    "The except block can handle specific types of exceptions or a generic exception.\n",

    "This allows developers to handle various exceptions differently based on the type of error encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Else Clause:\n",
    "The else keyword can be used to define a block of code that runs only if no errors were raised in the try block.\n",
    "It is useful for executing code that should run when no exceptions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally Block:\n",
    "The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "It is used for cleaning up resources or closing objects that need to be executed regardless of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Raising Exceptions:\n",
    "Developers can raise exceptions using the raise keyword to indicate specific conditions that should trigger an error.\n",
    "Custom exceptions can be raised with specific error messages to handle unique situations.\n",

    "6. Exception Types:\n",

    "1. Normal Set:\n",
    "Normal sets in Python are mutable collections that allow for the addition and removal of elements. They are represented by curly braces {} and support operations like adding elements using the add() method and updating the set with items from other collections using the update() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Frozenset:\n",
    "Frozensets in Python are immutable objects that do not allow modifications after creation. They are created using the frozenset() method and are useful when you need a set that remains constant and does not change. Frozensets do not support methods that modify the set, ensuring the set's elements remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically , the key difference between a normal set and a frozenset lies in their mutability; normal sets can be modified, while frozensets are immutable and do not allow changes after creation."

It allows for the creation of dictionaries using a compact syntax, making the code more readable and efficient. The syntax for dictionary comprehension is {key: value for vars in iterable}, where key and value represent the key-value pairs to be included in the dictionary, vars is the variable used to iterate over an iterable, and iterable is the collection of elements to iterate over."
